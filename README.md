# Welcome!

I'm Antonio Zarauz Moreno, mathematician based in Spain with a researcher mindset. Pursuing a PhD in geometrical properties of Banach spaces, I decided to study the geometric foundations of deep learning, becoming an active researcher in this field. I always try to provide new ideas and strategies in my repositories, aiming to cover useful use cases and keeping code as clean and generalistic as possible. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on self-supervised learning mechanisms, natural language understanding, multitask systems,...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning quantum ML (not that hard when you know well Hilbert spaces :face_with_spiral_eyes:).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on applied medical research in either computer vision or natural language processing.
